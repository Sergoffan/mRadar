**You need Visual Studio to compile this.**

Two projects in solution:

mCore - set the build directory of this project to your plugins folder.

mDebug - you can run this project straight from Visual Studio to play with the interface / WPF!  But don't run it in Debug mode it will crash and I haven't fixed that bug.

If you like this, your donation would help a lot.
