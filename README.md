======

Two projects in solution:

mCore - set the build directory of this project to your plugins folder.

mDebug - you can run this project straight from Visual Studio to play with the interface / WPF!  But don't run it in Debug mode it will crash and I haven't fixed that bug.

House scanner is disabled.  

If you like this, your donation would help a lot!  If you donate, I can respond more to requests, questions, maybe offer beta test new features.
